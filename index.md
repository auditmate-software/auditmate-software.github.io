# SOC 2 Evidence Collector (Linux)

A lightweight, self-hosted tool that automatically collects SOC 2 Type 1 evidence from Linux systems and packages it into auditor-ready artifacts.

Designed for small teams and startups preparing for their first SOC 2 audit without paying for expensive SaaS platforms.

## What this tool does

The SOC 2 Evidence Collector runs locally on your servers and gathers common evidence auditors request, including:

- System and OS information
- User and access configuration
- SSH and authentication settings
- Firewall rules and network configuration
- Installed packages
- Running services
- Relevant system logs

All evidence is exported into a structured archive that can be shared directly with auditors.

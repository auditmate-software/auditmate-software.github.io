# Automated SOC 2 Evidence Collection for Linux

**Audit-Mate365** is a lightweight, self-hosted tool that collects **auditor-ready SOC 2 evidence** from Linux systems — without SaaS platforms, agents, or weeks of manual work.

Run one command. Get a clean evidence archive your auditor can review immediately.

---

## What problem this solves

SOC 2 audits stall because Linux evidence is:
- Scattered across servers
- Manually collected with screenshots and commands
- Different every time an auditor asks for it

Audit-Mate365 standardizes and automates this process.

---

## What it does

Audit-Mate365 runs locally on your Linux systems and collects commonly requested SOC 2 Type 1 evidence, including:

- System and OS details
- User and account configuration
- SSH configuration and access controls
- Firewall rules and status
- Installed packages
- Running services
- Log configuration and retention indicators

All evidence is packaged into a **structured archive** designed for auditor review.

No dashboards. No cloud uploads. Just evidence.

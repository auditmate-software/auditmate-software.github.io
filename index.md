## Key Features

### 1. System Overview
AuditMate collects essential information about your system, including:  
- Hostname, operating system, and kernel version  
- Uptime and active users  
- Admin and regular users  
- Running services  
- Installed packages  
- Open ports  
- Firewall state  
- Pending system updates  

This gives you a snapshot of your system at a glance.

### 2. Change Tracking
- **Baseline Comparison**: Saves a snapshot of your system to `baseline.json` and compares future scans against it.  
- **Diff Detection**: Highlights added, removed, or modified items since the last baseline.  
- **Critical Alerts**: Certain changes, like new admin accounts or an open SSH port, trigger critical warnings.

### 3. Warnings
AuditMate flags potential security and system issues:  
- Multiple admin users detected

- System updates available  

Warnings are categorized as **critical** or **non-critical**.

### 4. Automation

- Multiple scan times can be set for daily, weekly, or yearly schedules.  
- Dry-run mode previews scheduled scans before applying them.  
- Optional summaries show all scheduled scan times for easy reference.

### 5. Licensing & Premium Features
- Paid licenses unlock advanced features like JSON export and detailed reports.  
- Licenses can be used on multiple devices.  
- Core functionality remains free for basic auditing, with optional upgrades for full reporting.

### 6. Output & Reporting
- Terminal summary provides immediate insights during a scan.  
- Baseline diffs show exactly what has changed since the last scan.  
- Premium reports can be exported in JSON for further analysis.  
- Exit codes reflect scan severity:  
  - `0` — No warnings  
  - `1` — Non-critical warnings  
  - `2` — Critical warnings

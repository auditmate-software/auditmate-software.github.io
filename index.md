# AuditMate – Complete System Auditing for Linux

AuditMate is an automated system auditing tool designed to give administrators full visibility into their Linux servers. It monitors system health, detects security issues, tracks changes over time, and provides actionable warnings—all with minimal setup.

## Key Features

### 1. System Overview
AuditMate collects essential information about your system, including:
- Hostname, operating system, and kernel version
- Uptime and active users
- Admin and regular users
- Running services
- Installed packages
- Open ports
- Firewall state
- Pending system updates

This gives you a snapshot of your system at a glance.

### 2. Change Tracking
- **Baseline Comparison**: AuditMate saves a snapshot of your system to a baseline file (`baseline.json`) and compares future scans to it.
- **Diff Detection**: Changes are highlighted, showing what was added, removed, or modified since the last baseline.
- **Critical Alerts**: Certain changes, such as new admin accounts or an open SSH port, trigger critical warnings.

### 3. Warnings & Alerts
AuditMate detects and flags potential security and system issues:
- Multiple admin users detected
- SSH port 22 open
- Firewall inactive or disabled
- System updates available

Warnings are categorized into **critical** and **non-critical**, which can trigger automation or notifications.

### 4. Automation
AuditMate supports fully automated scanning using cron:
- Schedule scans **daily**, **hourly**, **weekly**, **yearly**, or at custom minute intervals.
- Multiple scan times can be set for daily, weekly, or yearly schedules.
- Dry-run mode allows previewing scheduled scans before applying them.
- Optional summaries show all scheduled scan times for easy reference.

### 5. Licensing & Premium Features
- Some features are available only with a paid license.
- JSON export and detailed reports are unlocked with a valid license.
- Licenses can be activated on multiple devices.
- Ensures full reporting capabilities for premium users without restricting initial adoption.

### 6. Output & Reporting
- Terminal summary provides immediate insights during a scan.
- Baseline diffs show exactly what has changed since the last scan.
- Premium reports can be exported in JSON for further analysis.
- Exit codes reflect scan severity:
  - `0` — No warnings
  - `1` — Non-critical warnings
  - `2` — Critical warnings

### 7. Flexibility
- Designed to run on any Linux system with minimal dependencies.
- Can be scheduled automatically but also run manually.
- Works in offline environments.
- Highly configurable for multiple scan frequencies and times per day.
